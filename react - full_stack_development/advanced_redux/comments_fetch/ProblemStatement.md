Problem statement
Create a React application to retrieve random comments from the web.

Expected Output:

Tasks:

- Define a state slice that manages loading, error, and success states when fetching comments.
- Export the reducer function, action creators, and selector functions from this state slice.
- Add the reducer to the store and dispatch the appropriate actions to obtain the desired output.

Note:
The application should show "Loading" while the comments are being fetched.
For any issue or network error the application should display "failed to fetch comments" as error message.
