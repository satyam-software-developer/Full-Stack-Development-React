Problem statement
Create routes for different pages for the given scaffold.

In the App component we have used conditional rendering to display different pages.

Refactor the App Component to display the Home, List and Contact pages using Client Side Routing instead of Conditional Rendering.

Note: The Home page should render on "/", List page on "/list" and Contact page on "/contact" route.
