Problem statement
Define and export "actions constants" and "action creators" to implement start, pause, reset and increment timer functionality in the "timerAction.js" file.

Note:
The name for action constants should be consistent with the named imports in the 'timerReducer.js" file and also name for the action creators should be consistent with the named imports in the App component.

Note:
You only have to modify the "timerAction.js" file.
