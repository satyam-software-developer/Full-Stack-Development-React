Problem statement
Your friend has built an app that displays the people inside your network.

Now you both decided to collaborate on this project, and you are expected to add the following functionality.

Tasks:

- Implement the functionality to remove a person from the list on click of the button "X".
- Upon removing an individual, an alert should appear, notifying that a specific person has been removed, and it should display their email in alert as indicated in the expected output.

Hint:

- You can either delete the person from the array or use the show property of person to hide the person from the list.
- Use componentWillUnmount() method in the Person component to handle the alert.
