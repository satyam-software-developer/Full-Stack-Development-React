Tasks:

- You are provided with the all the required function to fetch and save the image in the Local Storage.
  - Implement appropriate LifeCycle method for fetching images from local storage and displaying them on the screen on mounting.

Test cases:
App renders an input, button and data correctly
Ensure that the app renders an input field and a button named "Add Button".
App should add the image when the form is submitted
Clicking the ‘Add button” for the valid image entered in the input field should add it to the local storage using the setItem() and display it on the screen.
