Problem statement
You have already improved the code structure and reduced complexity, and now the team has requested an additional feature for editing an expense within the list.

Expected Output:

Tasks:
Implement the feature to edit a transaction after clicking the edit button.
When the user clicks the edit icon, the form should automatically populate with the expense's text and amount.
The form's title and submit button should reflect "Edit transaction" when the edit button is clicked as shown in Expected Output.
Once a transaction is updated the transaction details should be appropriately updated, and the total, income, and expenses are recalculated accordingly.

Hint:
Use conditional rendering for showing different content over the button.
Use state management for editing process.
