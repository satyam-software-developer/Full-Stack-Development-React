Problem statement
Create a React app that uses the ternary operator to conditionally render the given components.

Note: Only do modification in the App component.

Expected Output:

If the login status is false display Login component.

If the login status is true display Home component.

Hint: (click to expand)

Create a boolean variable for login and set it to a default value.
Don't implement the functionality to change the login value instead do it manually.
