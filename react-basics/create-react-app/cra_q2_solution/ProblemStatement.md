Problem statement
You are developing a Login Page for your application. To achieve this, you've utilized multiple components, namely App.js, HomePage.js, Login.js, and Form.js.

The provided scaffold already contains the essential structure. Your task is to import and export the required components into each file to ensure the proper functioning of your application.

Test Cases:

1. Renders correctly
   - All the heading, inputs and button should be rendered as given in the scaffold and should not be tempered with.
2. Renders inputs with correct values
   - Export the two variables “name” and “email” defined in the HomePage and use them in the Form Component by importing it.
3. Component files exist and are not empty
   - Each component should be used to properly render the application.
