Problem statement
Create a React component named App that renders specific content, including a heading, a paragraph, and either an ordered or unordered list.

Expected Output:

Test Cases:
Render Heading:

The App component should render a heading using the h1 tag.
Render Paragraph:

The App component should render a paragraph using the p tag.
Render List with 3 Items:

The App component should render a list with either an ordered (<ol>) or unordered (<ul>) list with 3 items.

Hint:
Include all the CDN links in the head of the html file.
Use the ReactDOM.createRoot() to build the root element and use the root.render() method to render the App component.
